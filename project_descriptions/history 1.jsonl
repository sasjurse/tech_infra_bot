This can help us quickly iterate on the feedback visualization.\n\n2) **Charts and Graphs**: Depending on the type of feedback we collect, we can use charts and graphs to visually represent patterns and trends. For example, a bar chart showing the frequency of positive/negative feedback or a line graph showing the overall sentiment over time.\n\n3) **Word Clouds**: We can create word clouds to visually represent the most commonly used words in the feedback. This can provide a quick overview of the key themes emerging from the feedback.\n\n4) **Heatmaps**: If we have a large volume of feedback, we can use heatmaps to visualize the density of feedback across different areas. This can help us identify hotspots that require attention.\n\n5) **User Ratings**: Implement a user rating system (e.g., star ratings) and visualize the average rating over time. This can provide a quick snapshot of user satisfaction levels.\n\nThese are just a few options, and the choice of visualization will depend on the nature of the feedback we collect and the insights we want to gain from it.", "feedback_rating": null, "feedback_why": null}

We will have multiple projects to explore.\n\nSteps\n\n1) Sanity check legal issues for data entered into the app. Could some users be adding data that should not be?\n2) An initial data model for storing the project plan, chats and feedback. We will use SQLModel for easy schema creation and tracking.\n3) Feedback option on the chat replies.\n4) A database to store data in, likely postgres. \n5) Dockerize the streamlit interface\n6) Continuous Deployment. Use github actions to ensure that updates are pushed automatically.\n\n### Part 3:\n\nGoal: Make an educated guess of what the long term infrastructure will look like.\n\nSteps\n1) Which metrics are we using to evaluate the overall application? And which metrics should we monitor on chatbot performance?\n3) Are there any existing solutions in our cloud provider of choice that already does this well? Existing products of interest: Dialogflow by Google, Amazon Lex, Microsoft Bot Framework, IBM Watson Assistant, Rasa, Wit.ai\n4) How much context do the chatbot need? Do we need retrieval augmented generation? If so, which vector database should we use?\n\n\n### Part 4:\n\nGoal: Start building towards a sustainable infrastructure.\n\nSteps\n\n1) User management. \n2) Setup proper cost controls\n3) Logging and monitoring.\n4) Improve CI, create enough automated testing to cover common issues experienced so far.\n5) Separate the interface, the backend and the analytics. Unless we found interesting products to do major parts of our backend, we are doing python fastapi hosted on docker + the database. Frontend to be decided.\n\n### Part 5:\n\nGoal: Evaluate app performance\n\nSteps\n\n1) Make sure that usage statistics are collected\n2) Make a dashboard on usage and feedback on chat replies.\n2) Look at collected feedback.

Here are some strategies to maintain good UX throughout the project:\n\n1. **User-Centric Design:** Focus on understanding the needs, preferences, and pain points of the consultants who will be using the chatbot. Design the interface with a user-centric approach.\n\n2. **Simple and Intuitive Interface:** Keep the interface simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Ensure that users can easily find the information or options they need.\n\n3. **Consistent Design:** Maintain consistency in design elements such as color schemes, typography, and layout throughout the application. Consistency helps users familiarize themselves with the interface.\n\n4. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Include feedback options for users to provide input on the chatbot responses or the overall experience. This feedback can be valuable for improving the chatbot's performance and user satisfaction.\n\n5. **Accessibility:** Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities. Consider factors like color contrast, text size, and screen reader compatibility.\n\n6. **Responsiveness:** Make sure the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes. Test the interface on various devices to ensure a consistent experience.\n\n7. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the application for speed and performance. Slow response times or laggy interactions can negatively impact the user experience.\n\n8. **Onboarding Process:** Provide a seamless onboarding process for new users to familiarize themselves with the chatbot and its functionalities. Offer tutorials or tooltips if needed.\n\n9. **Error Handling:** Implement clear error messages and user prompts to guide users in case of mistakes or misunderstandings. Help users recover from errors gracefully.\n\n10. **User Testing:** Conduct regular user testing sessions with actual consultants to gather feedback and insights on the user experience. Use this feedback to iterate and improve the application.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies and focusing on user needs throughout the project, we can ensure a positive user experience for our consultants interacting with the chatbot.", "feedback_rating": null, "feedback_why": null}

User Feedback: This can be the fastest way to recognize UX issues, especially if your app has an option for users to report bugs or submit feedback about the app.\n\n2. Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing sessions where participants try to complete tasks under observation. This can help you to identify any areas where users struggle or become frustrated.\n\n3. Heatmap Tools: Use Heatmap tools that can track which areas on the interface users interact with the most. This tool can indicate if there are elements on the screen that the user is not interacting with.\n\n4. User Surveys: Ask users directly about their experience with different aspects of your application. \n\n5. Analytics: Collect analytic data on how users are interacting with your application. For instance, if there\u2019s a drop in usage on a particular page or important action, it might indicate a usability issue.\n\n6.

However, the most significant change to UX would likely involve enhancing the interaction with the chatbot. \n\nHere are suggested improvements:\n\n1) Contextual understanding: The chatbot should comprehend the context of the discussion to provide relevant and valuable responses. The current design assumes a linear conversation, but real conversations are often more complex. The chatbot should be able to handle follow-up queries, references to prior statements, and manage multiple threads of conversation.\n\n2) Knowledge base integration: Another improvement could be making the chatbot smart enough to search and resurface information from past proposals. This would mean integrating the bot with the proposal database and designing appropriate Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.\n\n3) User-friendly interface: Make the dialogue interface intuitive and simple to use. You may want to include features like autosuggestions, rich text options (for example, to highlight important sections), and an easy way to navigate through the conversation history. \n\n4) Feedback mechanism: A simple way for users to provide feedback on the chatbot's responses would greatly help to improve the chatbot's performance. This could be as simple as thumbs up/down on individual responses or a text box for more detailed feedback.\n\n5) Personalization: Personalize the experience for consultants by remembering past queries, proposal preferences, and other data to provide tailored assistance.\n\nThese adjustments should make the application more user-friendly, reducing the learning curve for new users and increasing overall user satisfaction.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Google Cloud provides various services for logging and monitoring applications. The most commonly used are:\n\n1. **Google Cloud Logging**: This is a fully managed real-time log management service that allows you to store, search, analyze, and alert on your log data and events. You can ingest data from virtually any source using Cloud Logging. It can handle system, debug, error logs, and can ingest custom log types too.\n\n2. **Google Cloud Monitoring**: This service is often used alongside Cloud Logging. It is used for infrastructure and application monitoring, creating dashboards, setting alerts, and for uptime checks. Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others.\n\n3. **Google Cloud Trace**: This service collects latency data from your applications and displays it in the Google Cloud Console. It helps you understand how long each part of your application took by analyzing the time taken by each service and dependency.\n\nFor your project, given your requirements and the need for fast iterations and scalable solutions, a combination of Google Cloud Logging and Google Cloud Monitoring would likely be the best solution. \n\nYou'll be able to evaluate performance using the metrics you've set and collected in Cloud Monitoring, while Cloud Logging can provide more atomic-level log data for deep-dive analysis. Plus, the integration between the two is seamless, allowing for efficient debugging and error handling. \n\nThis combined approach gives you robust logging, monitoring, alerting, and a comprehensive dashboard on your application's performance. However, the actual choice and implementation will depend heavily on your project\u2019s specific requirements.", "feedback_rating": null, "feedback_why": null}
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a discussion partner for a coding project. We are designing a roadmap and sketching a tech stack. Here are the current requirements: ### Requirements\n\nOur large consulting company is preparing a lot of proposals on tech infrastructure. Can we create a chatbot for our consultants to help discuss these proposals as they are being prepared?\n\nThe initial use case is improving the workflow when making one proposal.\nHowever, a likely extension is being able to search prior proposals to identify previous projects and consultants to learn from.\n\nThe solution should be hosted on Google Cloud Platform\n\n#### Users\n\nThe users of the app are our consultants who are creating a roadmap and tech infrastructure for a client need. We estimate this to be between 300 and 15000 users total.\n\n#### Initial assumptions\n\nThe app has two components, one where the user describes the project and a second where the user interacts with chatgpt and asks questions about it.\n\n#### Commercial considerations\n\nSince we know little about exactly what the user needs are, the roadmap needs to focus on early validation and fast iterations.. Here is the current plan: Overall milestones\n\n1) Prove value\n2) Iterate to create more value\n3) Enable scale\n\n\n### Part 1. Milestone \"Prove Value\"\n\nGoal: build a very simple app that the developers can use so that we can sanity check the viability of the project\nand improve our intuition about the key challenges we will face.\n\nSteps:\n\n1) Create a simple interface using streamlit\n2) Store query history on disk\n\nAll code will be in Python, only one project is supported.\nSince a key goal is sharing how the app look and feels, we will make a questionable design choice and include query history and project plans in our git repo.\n\n### Part 2. Milestone \"Prove Value\"\n\nGoal: Make it possible for internal users to also try the application. Start collecting data on what the chatbot does well or poorly. We will have multiple projects to explore.\n\nSteps\n\n1) Sanity check legal issues for data entered into the app. Could some users be adding data that is too confidential?\n2) An initial data model for storing the project plan, chats and feedback. We will use SQLModel for easy schema creation and tracking.\n3) Feedback option on the chat replies.\n4) A database to store data in, likely postgres. \n5) Dockerize the streamlit interface\n6) Continuous Deployment. Use github actions to ensure that updates are pushed automatically.\n7) Any optimizations we can do on prompt engineering?\n\nA possible extension is allowing direct changes to the project plan based on chat interactions (currently project plan is only updated by the user). e.g. the chat propose a change and the user agrees or not. \n\n### Part 3. Milestone \"Iterate to create more value\"\n\nGoal: Make an educated guess of what the long term infrastructure will look like.\n\nSteps\n1) Which metrics are we using to evaluate the overall application? And which metrics should we monitor on chatbot performance?\n2) Visualize query feedback. How are users responding to the assistant feedback=\n3) Are there any existing solutions in our cloud provider of choice that already does this well? Existing products of interest: Dialogflow by Google, Amazon Lex, Microsoft Bot Framework, IBM Watson Assistant, Rasa, Wit.ai\n4) How much context do the chatbot need? Do we need retrieval augmented generation? If so, which vector database should we use?\n\n### Part 4. Milestone \"Iterate to create more value\"\n\nGoal: Start building towards a sustainable infrastructure.\n\nSteps\n\n1) User management. \n2) Setup proper cost controls\n3) Logging and monitoring. Likely Google Cloud Logging and Google Cloud Monitoring.\n4) Improve CI, create enough automated testing to cover common issues experienced so far.\n5) Separate the interface, the backend and the analytics.

Milestone \"Enable scale\".\n\nEnable users to search through (text and semantic) projects to enable learning from previous projects and identifying possible discussion partners.\n\n\n### Part 8. Milestone \"Enable scale\".\n\nGoal: Enhance the chatbot capabilities and optimize the infrastructure for scalability and efficiency.\n\nSteps\n\n1) Optimize database queries and indexing for better performance as the user base grows.\n2) Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times.\n3) Monitor and optimize resource usage in Google Cloud Platform to manage costs effectively.\n4) Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle peak usage scenarios.\n5) Implement a backup and disaster recovery plan for critical data.\n", "feedback_rating": null, "feedback_why": null}
