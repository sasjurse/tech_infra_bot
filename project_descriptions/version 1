# Mission

Our goal is to create a chatbot that can discuss tech infrastructures. The app has two components, one where the user describes the interface and a second where the user interacts with chatgpt and asks questions about it.

# Part 1:

Very minimum setup

1) Streamlit app
2) Feedback option
3) Store query history on disk
4) Visualize query feedback

The key goal of part 1 is being able to let users test the application and storing feedback.

By inspecting the results so far, we can better understand project viability and key challenges to overcome.

# Part 2:

Minimum deployable version.

Steps
1) Think about tech stack. Use Langchain? Do we need retrieval augmented generation? What storage solutions are we using?
2) Dockerize
3) Continuous Deployment

# Part 3:
