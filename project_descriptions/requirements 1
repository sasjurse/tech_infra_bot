### Requirements

Our large consulting company is preparing a lot of proposals on tech infrastructure. Can we create a chatbot for our consultants to help discuss these proposals as they are being prepared?

The initial use case is improving the workflow when making one proposal.
However, a likely extension is being able to search prior proposals to identify previous projects and consultants to learn from.

The solution should be hosted on Google Cloud Platform

#### Users

The users of the app are our consultants who are creating a roadmap and tech infrastructure for a client need. We estimate this to be between 300 and 15000 users total.

#### Initial assumptions

The app has two components, one where the user describes the project and a second where the user interacts with chatgpt and asks questions about it.

#### Commercial considerations

Since we know little about exactly what the user needs are, the roadmap needs to focus on early validation and fast iterations.
